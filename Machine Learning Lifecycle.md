### ðŸ”„ Machine Learning Lifecycle

This diagram illustrates the **cyclical nature of building machine learning solutions**. It highlights each major stage involved from defining a problem to monitoring a deployed model.

### ðŸ§© Lifecycle Stages Explained

1. **Problem Definition**
   Clearly define the business or research problem you aim to solve with machine learning.

2. **Data Collection**
   Gather relevant raw data from various sources.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   Handle missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats, and prepare data for analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Understand the data distribution, trends, correlations, and detect anomalies.

5. **Feature Engineering and Selection**
   Create, select, and transform variables that improve model performance.

6. **Model Selection**
   Choose the right algorithms based on problem type and data characteristics.

7. **Model Training**
   Train the selected model(s) on training data to learn patterns.

8. **Model Evaluation and Tuning**
   Assess model performance using validation metrics, and fine-tune hyperparameters.

9. **Model Deployment**
   Deploy the best-performing model into a production environment.

10. **Model Monitoring and Maintenance**
    Continuously monitor the modelâ€™s performance and update it when needed.

### ðŸ§  Note

Model development is **not linear**; itâ€™s iterative. You may revisit earlier stages multiple times based on insights gained during evaluation or deployment.
