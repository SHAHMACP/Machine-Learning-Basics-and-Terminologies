# 🤖 Types of Machine Learning

This repository introduces the four main types of Machine Learning (ML):

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Semi-Supervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

Each type includes theoretical explanation, real-world examples, and Python code examples using Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and OpenAI Gym.

## 1️⃣ Supervised Learning

**Definition:**
The model learns from labeled data (features + target).

**📌 Real-World Examples:**

* Spam email detection (Spam or Not)
* House price prediction based on size, location, etc.

## 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning

**Definition:**
The model works on **unlabeled** data to discover patterns or groupings.

**📌 Real-World Examples:**

* Market segmentation of customers
* Social network analysis





---

## 3️⃣ Semi-Supervised Learning

**Definition:**
Uses a small set of labeled data along with a large set of unlabeled data.

**📌 Real-World Examples:**

* Image classification with few annotated images
* Webpage classification with partial tags



---

## 4️⃣ Reinforcement Learning

**Definition:**
An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards.

**📌 Real-World Examples:**

* Game-playing AI (Chess, Go, Atari games)
* Self-driving cars and robotics
