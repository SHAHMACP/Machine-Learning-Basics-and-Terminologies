# 🤖 Types of Machine Learning

This repository introduces the four main types of Machine Learning (ML):

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Semi-Supervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

Each type includes theoretical explanation, real-world examples, and Python code examples using Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and OpenAI Gym.

## 1️⃣ Supervised Learning

**Definition:**
The model learns from labeled data (features + target).

**📌 Real-World Examples:**

* Spam email detection (Spam or Not)
* House price prediction based on size, location, etc.

Here is a clean and informative `README.md` content for a GitHub repository titled **“Classification vs Regression in Supervised Learning”**, based on the image you shared:



### 🤖 Classification vs Regression in Supervised Learning

This repository provides a clear comparison between the two primary types of **Supervised Learning**:

* 🔵 **Classification** – for predicting **discrete** labels
* 🟠 **Regression** – for predicting **continuous** values

Includes visualizations, code notebooks, and real-world examples.



#### 📘 Classification

* **Goal**: Classify input data into categories (predict discrete responses).
* **Examples**:

  * Email spam detection: spam or not
  * Medical diagnosis: cancerous or benign tumor
* **Output**: Classes or categories
* **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM


#### 📙 Regression

* **Goal**: Predict continuous values based on input features.
* **Examples**:

  * Predicting temperature
  * Estimating the time until equipment failure
* **Output**: Numeric/continuous values
* **Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, SVR

## 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning

**Definition:**
The model works on **unlabeled** data to discover patterns or groupings.

**📌 Real-World Examples:**

* Market segmentation of customers
* Social network analysis

## 3️⃣ Semi-Supervised Learning

**Definition:**
Uses a small set of labeled data along with a large set of unlabeled data to improve learning.
Improve learning accuracy with minimal labelled data.

**📌 Real-World Examples:**

* Image classification with few annotated images
* Webpage classification with partial tags
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Medical diagnostics

## 4️⃣ Reinforcement Learning

**Definition:**
An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards.
The model learns by interacting with an environment (by trial and error) and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
Maximize cumulative reward by learning a strategy or policy.
