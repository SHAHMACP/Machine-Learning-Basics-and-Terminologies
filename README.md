* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: A broad field aiming to create machines that can simulate human intelligence.
* **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that allows systems to learn and improve from experience.
* **Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of ML focused on neural networks with many layers (deep architectures).

## 2. Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions. It is used in various domains such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and more.

## 3. Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

| Traditional Programming | Machine Learning      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Rules + Data → Output   | Data + Output → Rules |
| Explicit logic written  | Model learns patterns |
| Deterministic           | Probabilistic         |

## 5. Types of Machine Learning

* **Supervised Learning**
* **Unsupervised Learning**
* **Semi-Supervised Learning**
* **Reinforcement Learning**

---

## 6. Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-Supervised, and Reinforcement Learning

* **Supervised Learning**: Labeled data used (e.g., classification, regression)
* **Unsupervised Learning**: No labels (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)
* **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Few labeled and many unlabeled data points
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Agent learns by interacting with an environment via rewards/punishments

---

## 7. Supervised Learning: Regression vs Classification

* **Regression**: Predicts continuous values (e.g., house price)
* **Classification**: Predicts discrete labels (e.g., spam or not)

---

## 8. Common Machine Learning Terminologies

* **Feature**: Input variable
* **Label**: Output variable
* **Model**: Learned algorithm
* **Training**: Learning from data
* **Testing**: Evaluating performance
* **Overfitting**: Too complex, memorizes training data
* **Underfitting**: Too simple, misses patterns
* **Bias & Variance**: Errors due to assumptions vs fluctuations

---

## 9. Model Performance Metrics

### For Classification:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* ROC-AUC

### For Regression:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score
