# 🤖 AI vs ML vs DL vs Gen AI vs Data Analytics

Understanding the hierarchy and relationship between **Data Analytics**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Generative AI (Gen AI)** is key for anyone diving into modern data technologies.

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Hierarchy

These technologies are nested like concentric circles:

* **Data Analytics**: The outermost layer, focused on interpreting existing data to support decision-making.
* **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Broader field aiming to simulate human intelligence.
* **ML (Machine Learning)**: A subset of AI, allowing systems to learn from data.
* **DL (Deep Learning)**: A subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers.
* **Gen AI (Generative AI)**: A subset of DL that can generate new content (text, image, audio, etc.).

## 🔍 Definitions
To place an image next to each of the five concept sections in Markdown, you can use an HTML table layout for side-by-side formatting (since Markdown itself doesn’t support side-by-side layout well).



### 📈 Data Analytics

<table>
<tr>
<td width="20%">

* **Focus**: Analyzing structured data for trends and insights.
* **Tools**: Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI
* **Output**: Dashboards, reports, summaries
