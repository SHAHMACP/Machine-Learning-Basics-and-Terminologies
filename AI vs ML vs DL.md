Understanding the difference between **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)** is essential for anyone starting out in data science or machine learning. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they represent different concepts within the broader field of intelligent systems.

## üîç Definitions
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb181a88-a691-43d8-9b4a-ef07b2f239d6)


### 1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These machines are designed to think, learn, and make decisions like humans.

* Goal: Mimic human cognitive functions
* Applications: Chatbots, game AI, robotics, voice assistants

### 2. **Machine Learning (ML)**

ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

* Goal: Learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions
* Applications: Email spam filtering, recommendation systems, fraud detection

### 3. **Deep Learning (DL)**

DL is a subset of ML based on artificial neural networks with many layers (deep networks). It excels at automatically extracting features from raw data such as images, audio, and text.

* Goal: Mimic how the human brain processes information
* Applications: Image recognition, natural language processing, self-driving cars
