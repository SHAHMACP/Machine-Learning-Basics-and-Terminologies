## 🤖 Classical Programming vs Machine Learning

This session illustrates the fundamental difference between **classical (rule-based) programming** and **machine learning** using simple diagrams and real-life examples.

---

### 🧠 Concept Overview

#### 🔷 Classical Programming

In traditional programming:

* The developer provides **rules (logic)** and **data**.
* The computer produces **answers** based on the given logic.

📌 **Example**:
A spam filter uses explicit rules like:
`if "lottery" or "free money" in email: mark as spam`
This works but is rigid—slight variations bypass the rules.

#### 🔶 Machine Learning

In machine learning:

* You provide **data** and **answers (labels)**.
* The algorithm **learns rules** (model) from them.

📌 **Example**:
A spam classifier learns patterns from thousands of labeled spam and non-spam emails.
Over time, it generalizes and detects spam—even without predefined rules.

### 👁️ Real-World Example: Face Recognition

A face recognition system doesn’t get programmed with features like “nose” or “eye.”
Instead, it **learns features** by analyzing thousands of images and recognizing pixel patterns.
