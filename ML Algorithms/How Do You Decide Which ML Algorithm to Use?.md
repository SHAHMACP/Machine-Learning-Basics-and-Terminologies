## Step-by-Step Decision Strategy

### Step 1: Understand Your Problem Type

| Problem Type | Goal | Examples |
|--------------|------|----------|
| **Classification** | Predict discrete labels | Spam detection, disease classification |
| **Regression** | Predict numeric values | Price prediction, temperature forecast |
| **Clustering** | Discover natural groups | Customer segments, gene clusters |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Detect rare events | Fraud, faults, intrusions |
| **Recommendation** | Suggest items | Movies, products |
| **Ranking** | Order items by relevance | Search engine results |

## ðŸ› Final Advice

* Start **simple first** (e.g., Logistic or Linear Regression).
* Try **baseline models** to compare performance.
* Use **cross-validation** to reduce overfitting.
* Try **multiple models** and use GridSearch/RandomizedSearch for tuning.
* Combine models (ensemble) if needed.
